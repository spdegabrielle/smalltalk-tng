So currently {} is non-self-capturing and [] is self-capturing. What
if instead, the keyword "rec" (either "record" (== object) or
"recursive") were used to introduce a self-binding/open-recursion?

{ x -> x + 1 }	       	  	    { x -> x + 1 }

rec { x -> x + 1 }		    [ x -> x + 1 ]

It provides a nice place to put a name for self, too, if we decide
that's a good idea:

rec self { x -> x + 1 }
