	INTRODUCTION ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	FORTH is one of those alien languages which most working programmers regard in the same
	way as Haskell, LISP, and so on.  Something so strange that they'd rather any thoughts
	of it just go away so they can get on with writing this paying code.  But that's wrong
	and if you care at all about programming then you should at least understand all these
	languages, even if you will never use them.

	LISP is the ultimate high-level language, and features from LISP are being added every
	decade to the more common languages.  But FORTH is in some ways the ultimate in low level
	programming.  Out of the box it lacks features like dynamic memory management and even
	strings.  In fact, at its primitive level it lacks even basic concepts like IF-statements
	and loops.

	Why then would you want to learn FORTH?  There are several very good reasons.  First
	and foremost, FORTH is minimal.  You really can write a complete FORTH in, say, 2000
	lines of code.  I don't just mean a FORTH program, I mean a complete FORTH operating
	system, environment and language.  You could boot such a FORTH on a bare PC and it would
	come up with a prompt where you could start doing useful work.  The FORTH you have here
	isn't minimal and uses a Linux process as its 'base PC' (both for the purposes of making
	it a good tutorial). It's possible to completely understand the system.  Who can say they
	completely understand how Linux works, or gcc?

	Secondly FORTH has a peculiar bootstrapping property.  By that I mean that after writing
	a little bit of assembly to talk to the hardware and implement a few primitives, all the
	rest of the language and compiler is written in FORTH itself.  Remember I said before
	that FORTH lacked IF-statements and loops?  Well of course it doesn't really because
	such a lanuage would be useless, but my point was rather that IF-statements and loops are
	written in FORTH itself.

	Now of course this is common in other languages as well, and in those languages we call
	them 'libraries'.  For example in C, 'printf' is a library function written in C.  But
	in FORTH this goes way beyond mere libraries.  Can you imagine writing C's 'if' in C?
	And that brings me to my third reason: If you can write 'if' in FORTH, then why restrict
	yourself to the usual if/while/for/switch constructs?  You want a construct that iterates
	over every other element in a list of numbers?  You can add it to the language.  What
	about an operator which pulls in variables directly from a configuration file and makes
	them available as FORTH variables?  Or how about adding Makefile-like dependencies to
	the language?  No problem in FORTH.  This concept isn't common in programming languages,
	but it has a name (in fact two names): "macros" (by which I mean LISP-style macros, not
	the lame C preprocessor) and "domain specific languages" (DSLs).

	This tutorial isn't about learning FORTH as the language.  I'll point you to some references
	you should read if you're not familiar with using FORTH.  This tutorial is about how to
	write FORTH.  In fact, until you understand how FORTH is written, you'll have only a very
	superficial understanding of how to use it.

	So if you're not familiar with FORTH or want to refresh your memory here are some online
	references to read:

	ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This code draws heavily on the design of LINA FORTH (http://home.hccnet.nl/a.w.m.van.der.horst/lina.html)
	by Albert van der Horst.  Any similarities in the code are probably not accidental.

	Also I used this document (http://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/IOCCC/1992/buzzard.2.design) which really
	defies easy explanation.

	PUBLIC DOMAIN ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	I, the copyright holder of this work, hereby release it into the public domain. This applies worldwide.

	In case this is not legally possible, I grant any entity the right to use this work for any purpose,
	without any conditions, unless such conditions are required by law.

	SETTING UP ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Let's get a few housekeeping things out of the way.  Firstly because I need to draw lots of
	ASCII-art diagrams to explain concepts, the best way to look at this is using a window which
	uses a fixed width font and is at least this wide:

 <------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>

	Secondly make sure TABS are set to 8 characters.  The following should be a vertical
	line.  If not, sort out your tabs.

	|
        |
	|

	Thirdly I assume that your screen is at least 50 characters high.

	ASSEMBLING ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you want to actually run this FORTH, rather than just read it, you will need Linux on an
	i386.  Linux because instead of programming directly to the hardware on a bare PC which I
	could have done, I went for a simpler tutorial by assuming that the 'hardware' is a Linux
	process with a few basic system calls (read, write and exit and that's about all).  i386
	is needed because I had to write the assembly for a processor, and i386 is by far the most
	common.  (Of course when I say 'i386', any 32- or 64-bit x86 processor will do.  I'm compiling
	this on a 64 bit AMD Opteron).

	Again, to assemble this you will need gcc and gas (the GNU assembler).  The commands to
	assemble and run the code (save this file as 'jonesforth.S') are:

	gcc -m32 -nostdlib -static -Wl,-Ttext,0 -o jonesforth jonesforth.S
	./jonesforth

	You will see lots of 'Warning: unterminated string; newline inserted' messages from the
	assembler.  That's just because the GNU assembler doesn't have a good syntax for multi-line
	strings (or rather it used to, but the developers removed it!) so I've abused the syntax
	slightly to make things readable.  Ignore these warnings.

	If you want to run your own FORTH programs you can do:

	./jonesforth < myprog.f

	If you want to load your own FORTH code and then continue reading user commands, you can do:

	cat myfunctions.f - | ./jonesforth

	ASSEMBLER ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	(You can just skip to the next section -- you don't need to be able to read assembler to
	follow this tutorial).

	However if you do want to read the assembly code here are a few notes about gas (the GNU assembler):

	(1) Register names are prefixed with '%', so %eax is the 32 bit i386 accumulator.  The registers
	    available on i386 are: %eax, %ebx, %ecx, %edx, %esi, %edi, %ebp and %esp, and most of them
	    have special purposes.

	(2) Add, mov, etc. take arguments in the form SRC,DEST.  So mov %eax,%ecx moves %eax -> %ecx

	(3) Constants are prefixed with '$', and you mustn't forget it!  If you forget it then it
	    causes a read from memory instead, so:
	    mov $2,%eax		moves number 2 into %eax
	    mov 2,%eax		reads the 32 bit word from address 2 into %eax (ie. most likely a mistake)

	(4) gas has a funky syntax for local labels, where '1f' (etc.) means label '1:' "forwards"
	    and '1b' (etc.) means label '1:' "backwards".

	(5) 'ja' is "jump if above", 'jb' for "jump if below", 'je' "jump if equal" etc.

	(6) gas has a reasonably nice .macro syntax, and I use them a lot to make the code shorter and
	    less repetitive.

	For more help reading the assembler, do "info gas" at the Linux prompt.

	Now the tutorial starts in earnest.

	THE DICTIONARY ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	In FORTH as you will know, functions are called "words", and just as in other languages they
	have a name and a definition.  Here are two FORTH words:

	: DOUBLE DUP + ;		\ name is "DOUBLE", definition is "DUP +"
	: QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;	\ name is "QUADRUPLE", definition is "DOUBLE DOUBLE"

	Words, both built-in ones and ones which the programmer defines later, are stored in a dictionary
	which is just a linked list of dictionary entries.

	<--- DICTIONARY ENTRY (HEADER) ----------------------->
	+------------------------+--------+---------- - - - - +----------- - - - -
	| LINK POINTER           | LENGTH/| NAME	      | DEFINITION
	|			 | FLAGS  |     	      |
	+--- (4 bytes) ----------+- byte -+- n bytes  - - - - +----------- - - - -

	I'll come to the definition of the word later.  For now just look at the header.  The first
	4 bytes are the link pointer.  This points back to the previous word in the dictionary, or, for
	the first word in the dictionary it is just a NULL pointer.  Then comes a length/flags byte.
	The length of the word can be up to 31 characters (5 bits used) and the top three bits are used
	for various flags which I'll come to later.  This is followed by the name itself, and in this
	implementation the name is rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes by padding it with zero bytes.
	That's just to ensure that the definition starts on a 32 bit boundary.

	A FORTH variable called LATEST contains a pointer to the most recently defined word, in
	other words, the head of this linked list.

	DOUBLE and QUADRUPLE might look like this:

	  pointer to previous word
	   ^
	   |
	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | (definition ...)
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
           ^       len                         padding
	   |
	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
	| LINK    | 9 | Q | U | A | D | R | U | P | L | E | 0 | 0 | (definition ...)
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------- - - - -
           ^       len                                     padding
           |
           |
	  LATEST

	You shoud be able to see from this how you might implement functions to find a word in
	the dictionary (just walk along the dictionary entries starting at LATEST and matching
	the names until you either find a match or hit the NULL pointer at the end of the dictionary);
	and add a word to the dictionary (create a new definition, set its LINK to LATEST, and set
	LATEST to point to the new word).  We'll see precisely these functions implemented in
	assembly code later on.

	One interesting consequence of using a linked list is that you can redefine words, and
	a newer definition of a word overrides an older one.  This is an important concept in
	FORTH because it means that any word (even "built-in" or "standard" words) can be
	overridden with a new definition, either to enhance it, to make it faster or even to
	disable it.  However because of the way that FORTH words get compiled, which you'll
	understand below, words defined using the old definition of a word continue to use
	the old definition.  Only words defined after the new definition use the new definition.

	DIRECT THREADED CODE ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now we'll get to the really crucial bit in understanding FORTH, so go and get a cup of tea
	or coffee and settle down.  It's fair to say that if you don't understand this section, then you
	won't "get" how FORTH works, and that would be a failure on my part for not explaining it well.
	So if after reading this section a few times you don't understand it, please email me
	(rich@annexia.org).

	Let's talk first about what "threaded code" means.  Imagine a peculiar version of C where
	you are only allowed to call functions without arguments.  (Don't worry for now that such a
	language would be completely useless!)  So in our peculiar C, code would look like this:

	f ()
	{
	  a ();
	  b ();
	  c ();
	}

	and so on.  How would a function, say 'f' above, be compiled by a standard C compiler?
	Probably into assembly code like this.  On the right hand side I've written the actual
	i386 machine code.

	f:
	  CALL a			E8 08 00 00 00
	  CALL b			E8 1C 00 00 00
	  CALL c			E8 2C 00 00 00
	  ; ignore the return from the function for now

	"E8" is the x86 machine code to "CALL" a function.  In the first 20 years of computing
	memory was hideously expensive and we might have worried about the wasted space being used
	by the repeated "E8" bytes.  We can save 20% in code size (and therefore, in expensive memory)
	by compressing this into just:

	08 00 00 00		Just the function addresses, without
	1C 00 00 00		the CALL prefix.
	2C 00 00 00

	[Historical note: If the execution model that FORTH uses looks strange from the following
	paragraphs, then it was motivated entirely by the need to save memory on early computers.
	This code compression isn't so important now when our machines have more memory in their L1
	caches than those early computers had in total, but the execution model still has some
	useful properties].

	Of course this code won't run directly any more.  Instead we need to write an interpreter
	which takes each pair of bytes and calls it.

	On an i386 machine it turns out that we can write this interpreter rather easily, in just
	two assembly instructions which turn into just 3 bytes of machine code.  Let's store the
	pointer to the next word to execute in the %esi register:

		08 00 00 00	<- We're executing this one now.  %esi is the _next_ one to execute.
	%esi -> 1C 00 00 00
		2C 00 00 00

	The all-important i386 instruction is called LODSL (or in Intel manuals, LODSW).  It does
	two things.  Firstly it reads the memory at %esi into the accumulator (%eax).  Secondly it
	increments %esi by 4 bytes.  So after LODSL, the situation now looks like this:

		08 00 00 00	<- We're still executing this one
		1C 00 00 00	<- %eax now contains this address (0x0000001C)
	%esi -> 2C 00 00 00

	Now we just need to jump to the address in %eax.  This is again just a single x86 instruction
	written JMP *(%eax).  And after doing the jump, the situation looks like:

		08 00 00 00
		1C 00 00 00	<- Now we're executing this subroutine.
	%esi -> 2C 00 00 00

	To make this work, each subroutine is followed by the two instructions 'LODSL; JMP *(%eax)'
	which literally make the jump to the next subroutine.

	And that brings us to our first piece of actual code!  Well, it's a macro.
*/

/* NEXT macro. */
	.macro NEXT
	lodsl
	jmp *(%eax)
	.endm

/*	The macro is called NEXT.  That's a FORTH-ism.  It expands to those two instructions.

	Every FORTH primitive that we write has to be ended by NEXT.  Think of it kind of like
	a return.

	The above describes what is known as direct threaded code.

	To sum up: We compress our function calls down to a list of addresses and use a somewhat
	magical macro to act as a "jump to next function in the list".  We also use one register (%esi)
	to act as a kind of instruction pointer, pointing to the next function in the list.

	I'll just give you a hint of what is to come by saying that a FORTH definition such as:

	: QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;

	actually compiles (almost, not precisely but we'll see why in a moment) to a list of
	function addresses for DOUBLE, DOUBLE and a special function called EXIT to finish off.

	At this point, REALLY EAGLE-EYED ASSEMBLY EXPERTS are saying "JONES, YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE!".

	I lied about JMP *(%eax).  

	INDIRECT THREADED CODE ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	It turns out that direct threaded code is interesting but only if you want to just execute
	a list of functions written in assembly language.  So QUADRUPLE would work only if DOUBLE
	was an assembly language function.  In the direct threaded code, QUADRUPLE would look like:

		+------------------+
		| addr of DOUBLE  --------------------> (assembly code to do the double)
		+------------------+                    NEXT
	%esi ->	| addr of DOUBLE   |
		+------------------+

	We can add an extra indirection to allow us to run both words written in assembly language
	(primitives written for speed) and words written in FORTH themselves as lists of addresses.

	The extra indirection is the reason for the brackets in JMP *(%eax).

	Let's have a look at how QUADRUPLE and DOUBLE really look in FORTH:

	        : QUADRUPLE DOUBLE DOUBLE ;

		+------------------+
		| codeword         |		   : DOUBLE DUP + ;
		+------------------+
		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
		+------------------+               | codeword         |
		| addr of DOUBLE   |		   +------------------+
		+------------------+	   	   | addr of DUP   --------------> +------------------+
		| addr of EXIT	   |		   +------------------+            | codeword      -------+
		+------------------+	   %esi -> | addr of +     --------+	   +------------------+   |
						   +------------------+	   |	   | assembly to    <-----+
						   | addr of EXIT     |    |       | implement DUP    |
						   +------------------+	   |	   |	..	      |
									   |	   |    ..            |
									   |	   | NEXT             |
									   |	   +------------------+
									   |
									   +-----> +------------------+
										   | codeword      -------+
										   +------------------+   |
										   | assembly to   <------+
										   | implement +      |
										   | 	..            |
										   | 	..            |
										   | NEXT      	      |
										   +------------------+

	This is the part where you may need an extra cup of tea/coffee/favourite caffeinated
	beverage.  What has changed is that I've added an extra pointer to the beginning of
	the definitions.  In FORTH this is sometimes called the "codeword".  The codeword is
	a pointer to the interpreter to run the function.  For primitives written in
	assembly language, the "interpreter" just points to the actual assembly code itself.
	They don't need interpreting, they just run.

	In words written in FORTH (like QUADRUPLE and DOUBLE), the codeword points to an interpreter
	function.

	I'll show you the interpreter function shortly, but let's recall our indirect
	JMP *(%eax) with the "extra" brackets.  Take the case where we're executing DOUBLE
	as shown, and DUP has been called.  Note that %esi is pointing to the address of +

	The assembly code for DUP eventually does a NEXT.  That:

	(1) reads the address of + into %eax		%eax points to the codeword of +
	(2) increments %esi by 4
	(3) jumps to the indirect %eax			jumps to the address in the codeword of +,
							ie. the assembly code to implement +

		+------------------+
		| codeword         |
		+------------------+
		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
		+------------------+               | codeword         |
		| addr of DOUBLE   |		   +------------------+
		+------------------+	   	   | addr of DUP   --------------> +------------------+
		| addr of EXIT	   |		   +------------------+            | codeword      -------+
		+------------------+	   	   | addr of +     --------+	   +------------------+   |
						   +------------------+	   |	   | assembly to    <-----+
					   %esi -> | addr of EXIT     |    |       | implement DUP    |
						   +------------------+	   |	   |	..	      |
									   |	   |    ..            |
									   |	   | NEXT             |
									   |	   +------------------+
									   |
									   +-----> +------------------+
										   | codeword      -------+
										   +------------------+   |
									now we're  | assembly to   <------+
									executing  | implement +      |
									this	   | 	..            |
									function   | 	..            |
										   | NEXT      	      |
										   +------------------+

	So I hope that I've convinced you that NEXT does roughly what you'd expect.  This is
	indirect threaded code.

	I've glossed over four things.  I wonder if you can guess without reading on what they are?

	.
	.
	.

	My list of four things are: (1) What does "EXIT" do?  (2) which is related to (1) is how do
	you call into a function, ie. how does %esi start off pointing at part of QUADRUPLE, but
	then point at part of DOUBLE.  (3) What goes in the codeword for the words which are written
	in FORTH?  (4) How do you compile a function which does anything except call other functions
	ie. a function which contains a number like : DOUBLE 2 * ; ?

	THE INTERPRETER AND RETURN STACK ------------------------------------------------------------

	Going at these in no particular order, let's talk about issues (3) and (2), the interpreter
	and the return stack.

	Words which are defined in FORTH need a codeword which points to a little bit of code to
	give them a "helping hand" in life.  They don't need much, but they do need what is known
	as an "interpreter", although it doesn't really "interpret" in the same way that, say,
	Java bytecode used to be interpreted (ie. slowly).  This interpreter just sets up a few
	machine registers so that the word can then execute at full speed using the indirect
	threaded model above.

	One of the things that needs to happen when QUADRUPLE calls DOUBLE is that we save the old
	%esi ("instruction pointer") and create a new one pointing to the first word in DOUBLE.
	Because we will need to restore the old %esi at the end of DOUBLE (this is, after all, like
	a function call), we will need a stack to store these "return addresses" (old values of %esi).

	As you will have read, when reading the background documentation, FORTH has two stacks,
	an ordinary stack for parameters, and a return stack which is a bit more mysterious.  But
	our return stack is just the stack I talked about in the previous paragraph, used to save
	%esi when calling from a FORTH word into another FORTH word.

	In this FORTH, we are using the normal stack pointer (%esp) for the parameter stack.
	We will use the i386's "other" stack pointer (%ebp, usually called the "frame pointer")
	for our return stack.

	I've got two macros which just wrap up the details of using %ebp for the return stack.
	You use them as for example "PUSHRSP %eax" (push %eax on the return stack) or "POPRSP %ebx"
	(pop top of return stack into %ebx).
*/

/* Macros to deal with the return stack. */
	.macro PUSHRSP reg
	lea -4(%ebp),%ebp	// push reg on to return stack
	movl \reg,(%ebp)
	.endm

	.macro POPRSP reg
	mov (%ebp),\reg		// pop top of return stack to reg
	lea 4(%ebp),%ebp
	.endm

/*
	And with that we can now talk about the interpreter.

	In FORTH the interpreter function is often called DOCOL (I think it means "DO COLON" because
	all FORTH definitions start with a colon, as in : DOUBLE DUP + ;

	The "interpreter" (it's not really "interpreting") just needs to push the old %esi on the
	stack and set %esi to the first word in the definition.  Remember that we jumped to the
	function using JMP *(%eax)?  Well a consequence of that is that conveniently %eax contains
	the address of this codeword, so just by adding 4 to it we get the address of the first
	data word.  Finally after setting up %esi, it just does NEXT which causes that first word
	to run.
*/

/* DOCOL - the interpreter! */
	.text
	.align 4
DOCOL:
	PUSHRSP %esi		// push %esi on to the return stack
	addl $4,%eax		// %eax points to codeword, so make
	movl %eax,%esi		// %esi point to first data word
	NEXT

/*
	Just to make this absolutely clear, let's see how DOCOL works when jumping from QUADRUPLE
	into DOUBLE:

		QUADRUPLE:
		+------------------+
		| codeword         |
		+------------------+		   DOUBLE:
		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
		+------------------+       %eax -> | addr of DOCOL    |
	%esi ->	| addr of DOUBLE   |		   +------------------+
		+------------------+	   	   | addr of DUP      |
		| addr of EXIT	   |		   +------------------+
		+------------------+               | etc.             |

	First, the call to DOUBLE calls DOCOL (the codeword of DOUBLE).  DOCOL does this:  It
	pushes the old %esi on the return stack.  %eax points to the codeword of DOUBLE, so we
	just add 4 on to it to get our new %esi:

		QUADRUPLE:
		+------------------+
		| codeword         |
		+------------------+		   DOUBLE:
		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
top of return	+------------------+       %eax -> | addr of DOCOL    |
stack points ->	| addr of DOUBLE   |	   + 4 =   +------------------+
		+------------------+	   %esi -> | addr of DUP      |

	Then we do NEXT, and because of the magic of threaded code that increments %esi again
	and calls DUP.

	Well, it seems to work.

	One minor point here.  Because DOCOL is the first bit of assembly actually to be defined
	in this file (the others were just macros), and because I usually compile this code with the
	text segment starting at address 0, DOCOL has address 0.  So if you are disassembling the
	code and see a word with a codeword of 0, you will immediately know that the word is
	written in FORTH (it's not an assembler primitive) and so uses DOCOL as the interpreter.

	STARTING UP ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now let's get down to nuts and bolts.  When we start the program we need to set up
	a few things like the return stack.  But as soon as we can, we want to jump into FORTH
	code (albeit much of the "early" FORTH code will still need to be written as
	assembly language primitives).

	This is what the set up code does.  Does a tiny bit of house-keeping, sets up the
	separate return stack (NB: Linux gives us the ordinary parameter stack already), then
	immediately jumps to a FORTH word called COLD.  COLD stands for cold-start.  In ISO
	FORTH (but not in this FORTH), COLD can be called at any time to completely reset
	the state of FORTH, and there is another word called WARM which does a partial reset.

	BUILT-IN WORDS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Remember our dictionary entries (headers).  Let's bring those together with the codeword
	and data words to see how : DOUBLE DUP + ; really looks in memory.

	  pointer to previous word
	   ^
	   |
	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+--|---------+------------+------------+

	   |							  V
	  LINK in next word				points to codeword of DUP
	
	Initially we can't just write ": DOUBLE DUP + ;" (ie. that literal string) here because we
	don't yet have anything to read the string, break it up at spaces, parse each word, etc. etc.
	So instead we will have to define built-in words using the GNU assembler data constructors
	(like .int, .byte, .string, .ascii and so on -- look them up in the gas info page if you are
	unsure of them).

	The long way would be:
	.int <link to previous word>
	.byte 6			// len
	.ascii "DOUBLE"		// string
	.byte 0			// padding
DOUBLE: .int DOCOL		// codeword
	.int DUP		// pointer to codeword of DUP
	.int PLUS		// pointer to codeword of +
	.int EXIT		// pointer to codeword of EXIT

	That's going to get quite tedious rather quickly, so here I define an assembler macro
	so that I can just write:

	defword "DOUBLE",6,,DOUBLE
	.int DUP,PLUS,EXIT

	and I'll get exactly the same effect.

	Don't worry too much about the exact implementation details of this macro - it's complicated!

	RETURNING FROM FORTH WORDS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Time to talk about what happens when we EXIT a function.  In this diagram QUADRUPLE has called
	DOUBLE, and DOUBLE is about to exit (look at where %esi is pointing):

		QUADRUPLE
		+------------------+
		| codeword         |

		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
		+------------------+               | codeword         |

		+------------------+	   	   | addr of +        |
						   +------------------+
					   %esi -> | addr of EXIT     |
						   +------------------+

	What happens when the + function does NEXT?  Well, the following code is executed.
*/

	defcode "EXIT",4,,EXIT
	POPRSP %esi		// pop return stack into %esi
	NEXT

/*
	EXIT gets the old %esi which we saved from before on the return stack, and puts it in %esi.
	So after this (but just before NEXT) we get:

		QUADRUPLE
		+------------------+
		| codeword         |
		+------------------+		   DOUBLE
		| addr of DOUBLE  ---------------> +------------------+
		+------------------+               | codeword         |

		| addr of EXIT	   |		   +------------------+
		+------------------+	   	   | addr of +        |
						   +------------------+
						   | addr of EXIT     |
						   +------------------+

	And NEXT just completes the job by, well in this case just by calling DOUBLE again :-)

	LITERALS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	The final point I "glossed over" before was how to deal with functions that do anything
	apart from calling other functions.  For example, suppose that DOUBLE was defined like this:

	: DOUBLE 2 * ;

	It does the same thing, but how do we compile it since it contains the literal 2?  One way
	would be to have a function called "2" (which you'd have to write in assembler), but you'd need
	a function for every single literal that you wanted to use.

	FORTH solves this by compiling the function using a special word called LIT:

	+---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
	| (usual header of DOUBLE)  | DOCOL | LIT   | 2     | *     | EXIT  |
	+---------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+

	LIT is executed in the normal way, but what it does next is definitely not normal.  It
	looks at %esi (which now points to the literal 2), grabs it, pushes it on the stack, then
	manipulates %esi in order to skip the literal as if it had never been there.

	What's neat is that the whole grab/manipulate can be done using a single byte single
	i386 instruction, our old friend LODSL.  Rather than me drawing more ASCII-art diagrams,
	see if you can find out how LIT works:
*/

	defcode "LIT",3,,LIT
	// %esi points to the next command, but in this case it points to the next
	// literal 32 bit integer.  Get that literal into %eax and increment %esi.
	// On x86, it's a convenient single byte instruction!  (cf. NEXT macro)
	lodsl
	push %eax		// push the literal number on to stack
	NEXT

/*
	MEMORY ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	As important point about FORTH is that it gives you direct access to the lowest levels
	of the machine.  Manipulating memory directly is done frequently in FORTH, and these are
	the primitive words for doing it.

	INPUT AND OUTPUT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	These are our first really meaty/complicated FORTH primitives.  I have chosen to write them in
	assembler, but surprisingly in "real" FORTH implementations these are often written in terms
	of more fundamental FORTH primitives.  I chose to avoid that because I think that just obscures
	the implementation.  After all, you may not understand assembler but you can just think of it
	as an opaque block of code that does what it says.

	Let's discuss input first.

	The FORTH word KEY reads the next byte from stdin (and pushes it on the parameter stack).
	So if KEY is called and someone hits the space key, then the number 32 (ASCII code of space)
	is pushed on the stack.

	In FORTH there is no distinction between reading code and reading input.  We might be reading
	and compiling code, we might be reading words to execute, we might be asking for the user
	to type their name -- ultimately it all comes in through KEY.

	The implementation of KEY uses an input buffer of a certain size (defined at the end of the
	program).  It calls the Linux read(2) system call to fill this buffer and tracks its position
	in the buffer using a couple of variables, and if it runs out of input buffer then it refills
	it automatically.  The other thing that KEY does is if it detects that stdin has closed, it
	exits the program, which is why when you hit ^D the FORTH system cleanly exits.

	Back to input, WORD is a FORTH word which reads the next full word of input.

	What it does in detail is that it first skips any blanks (spaces, tabs, newlines and so on).
	Then it calls KEY to read characters into an internal buffer until it hits a blank.  Then it
	calculates the length of the word it read and returns the address and the length as
	two words on the stack (with address at the top).

	Notice that WORD has a single internal buffer which it overwrites each time (rather like
	a static C string).  Also notice that WORD's internal buffer is just 32 bytes long and
	there is NO checking for overflow.  31 bytes happens to be the maximum length of a
	FORTH word that we support, and that is what WORD is used for: to read FORTH words when
	we are compiling and executing code.  The returned strings are not NUL-terminated, so
	in some crazy-world you could define FORTH words containing ASCII NULs, although why
	you'd want to is a bit beyond me.

	WORD is not suitable for just reading strings (eg. user input) because of all the above
	peculiarities and limitations.

	Note that when executing, you'll see:
	WORD FOO
	which puts "FOO" and length 3 on the stack, but when compiling:

	DICTIONARY LOOK UPS ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	We're building up to our prelude on how FORTH code is compiled, but first we need yet more infrastructure.

	The FORTH word FIND takes a string (a word as parsed by WORD -- see above) and looks it up in the
	dictionary.  What it actually returns is the address of the dictionary header, if it finds it,
	or 0 if it didn't.

	So if DOUBLE is defined in the dictionary, then WORD DOUBLE FIND returns the following pointer:

    pointer to this

	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+

	See also >CFA which takes a dictionary entry pointer and returns a pointer to the codeword.

	FIND doesn't find dictionary entries which are flagged as HIDDEN.  See below for why.

	FIND returns the dictionary pointer, but when compiling we need the codeword pointer (recall
	that FORTH definitions are compiled into lists of codeword pointers).  The standard FORTH
	word >CFA turns a dictionary pointer into a codeword pointer.

	The example below shows the result of:

		WORD DOUBLE FIND >CFA

	FIND returns a pointer to this

	Notes:

	Because names vary in length, this isn't just a simple increment.

	In this FORTH you cannot easily turn a codeword pointer back into a dictionary entry pointer, but
	that is not true in most FORTH implementations where they store a back pointer in the definition
	(with an obvious memory/complexity cost).  The reason they do this is that it is useful to be
	able to go backwards (codeword -> dictionary entry) in order to decompile FORTH definitions.

	What does CFA stand for?  My best guess is "Code Field Address".

/*
	COMPILING ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Now we'll talk about how FORTH compiles words.  Recall that a word definition looks like this:

		: DOUBLE DUP + ;

	and we have to turn this into:

	  pointer to previous word
	   ^
	   |
	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+--|---------+------------+------------+
           ^       len                         pad  codeword      |
	   |							  V
	  LATEST points here				points to codeword of DUP

	There are several problems to solve.  Where to put the new word?  How do we read words?  How
	do we define the words : (COLON) and ; (SEMICOLON)?

	FORTH solves this rather elegantly and as you might expect in a very low-level way which
	allows you to change how the compiler works on your own code.

	FORTH has an INTERPRETER function (a true interpreter this time, not DOCOL) which runs in a
	loop, reading words (using WORD), looking them up (using FIND), turning them into codeword
	pointers (using >CFA) and deciding what to do with them.

	What it does depends on the mode of the interpreter (in variable STATE).

	When STATE is zero, the interpreter just runs each word as it looks them up.  This is known as
	immediate mode.

	The interesting stuff happens when STATE is non-zero -- compiling mode.  In this mode the
	interpreter appends the codeword pointer to user memory (the HERE variable points to the next
	free byte of user memory).

	So you may be able to see how we could define : (COLON).  The general plan is:

	(1) Use WORD to read the name of the function being defined.

	(2) Construct the dictionary entry -- just the header part -- in user memory:

    pointer to previous word (from LATEST)			+-- Afterwards, HERE points here, where
	   ^							|   the interpreter will start appending
	   |							V   codewords.
	+--|------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword

	(3) Set LATEST to point to the newly defined word, ...

	(4) .. and most importantly leave HERE pointing just after the new codeword.  This is where
	    the interpreter will append codewords.

	(5) Set STATE to 1.  This goes into compile mode so the interpreter starts appending codewords to
	    our partially-formed header.

	After : has run, our input is here:

	: DOUBLE DUP + ;
	         ^
		 |
		Next byte returned by KEY

	so the interpreter (now it's in compile mode, so I guess it's really the compiler) reads DUP,
	gets its codeword pointer, and appends it:

									     +-- HERE updated to point here.
									     |
									     V
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword

	Next we read +, get the codeword pointer, and append it:

											  +-- HERE updated to point here.
											  |
											  V
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword

	The issue is what happens next.  Obviously what we _don't_ want to happen is that we
	read ";" and compile it and go on compiling everything afterwards.

	At this point, FORTH uses a trick.  Remember the length byte in the dictionary definition
	isn't just a plain length byte, but can also contain flags.  One flag is called the
	IMMEDIATE flag (F_IMMED in this code).  If a word in the dictionary is flagged as
	IMMEDIATE then the interpreter runs it immediately _even if it's in compile mode_.

	I hope I don't need to explain that ; (SEMICOLON) just such a word, flagged as IMMEDIATE.
	And all it does is append the codeword for EXIT on to the current definition and switch
	back to immediate mode (set STATE back to 0).  Shortly we'll see the actual definition
	of ; and we'll see that it's really a very simple definition, declared IMMEDIATE.

	After the interpreter reads ; and executes it 'immediately', we get this:

	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
	| LINK    | 6 | D | O | U | B | L | E | 0 | DOCOL      | DUP        | +          | EXIT       |
	+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+------------+------------+------------+
                   len                         pad  codeword					       ^
												       |
												      HERE

	STATE is set to 0.

	And that's it, job done, our new definition is compiled, and we're back in immediate mode
	just reading and executing words, perhaps including a call to test our new word DOUBLE.

	The only last wrinkle in this is that while our word was being compiled, it was in a
	half-finished state.  We certainly wouldn't want DOUBLE to be called somehow during
	this time.  There are several ways to stop this from happening, but in FORTH what we
	do is flag the word with the HIDDEN flag (F_HIDDEN in this code) just while it is
	being compiled.  This prevents FIND from finding it, and thus in theory stops any
	chance of it being called.

	Compared to the description above, the actual definition of : (COLON) is comparatively simple:
*/

/*
	EXTENDING THE COMPILER ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Words flagged with IMMEDIATE (F_IMMED) aren't just for the FORTH compiler to use.  You can define
	your own IMMEDIATE words too, and this is a crucial aspect when extending basic FORTH, because
	it allows you in effect to extend the compiler itself.  Does gcc let you do that?

	Standard FORTH words like IF, WHILE, .", [ and so on are all written as extensions to the basic
	compiler, and are all IMMEDIATE words.

	The IMMEDIATE word toggles the F_IMMED (IMMEDIATE flag) on the most recently defined word,
	or on the current word if you call it in the middle of a definition.

	Typical usage is:

	: MYIMMEDWORD IMMEDIATE
		...definition...
	;

	but some FORTH programmers write this instead:

	: MYIMMEDWORD
		...definition...
	; IMMEDIATE

	The two usages are equivalent, to a first approximation.

	' (TICK) is a standard FORTH word which returns the codeword pointer of the next word.

	The common usage is:

	' FOO ,

	which appends the codeword of FOO to the current word we are defining (this only works in compiled code).

	You tend to use ' in IMMEDIATE words.  For example an alternate (and rather useless) way to define
	a literal 2 might be:

	: LIT2 IMMEDIATE
		' LIT ,		\ Appends LIT to the currently-being-defined word
		2 ,		\ Appends the number 2 to the currently-being-defined word
	;

	So you could do:

	: DOUBLE LIT2 * ;

	(If you don't understand how LIT2 works, then you should review the material about compiling words
	and immediate mode).

	This definition of ' uses a cheat which I copied from buzzard92.  As a result it only works in
	compiled code.  It is possible to write a version of ' based on WORD, FIND, >CFA which works in

/*
	BRANCHING ----------------------------------------------------------------------

	It turns out that all you need in order to define looping constructs, IF-statements, etc.
	are two primitives.

	BRANCH is an unconditional branch. 0BRANCH is a conditional branch (it only branches if the
	top of stack is zero).

	The diagra below shows how BRANCH works in some imaginary compiled word.  When BRANCH executes,
	%esi starts by pointing to the offset field (compare to LIT above):

	+---------------------+-------+---- - - ---+------------+------------+---- - - - ----+------------+
	| (Dictionary header) | DOCOL |            | BRANCH     | offset     | (skipped)     | word       |
	+---------------------+-------+---- - - ---+------------+-----|------+---- - - - ----+------------+
								   ^  |			      ^
								   |  |			      |
								   |  +-----------------------+
								  %esi added to offset

	The offset is added to %esi to make the new %esi, and the result is that when NEXT runs, execution
	continues at the branch target.  Negative offsets work as expected.

	0BRANCH is the same except the branch happens conditionally.

	Now standard FORTH words such as IF, THEN, ELSE, WHILE, REPEAT, etc. can be implemented entirely
	in FORTH.  They are IMMEDIATE words which append various combinations of BRANCH or 0BRANCH
	into the word currently being compiled.

	As an example, code written like this:

		condition-code IF true-part THEN rest-code

	compiles to:

		condition-code 0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest-code

	Some notes about the code:

	\ (backslash) is the FORTH way to start a comment which goes up to the next newline.  However
	because this is a C-style string, I have to escape the backslash, which is why they appear as
	\\ comment.

	Similarly, any backslashes in the code are doubled, and " becomes \" (eg. the definition of ."
	is written as : .\" ... ;)

	I use indenting to show structure.  The amount of whitespace has no meaning to FORTH however
	except that you must use at least one whitespace character between words, and words themselves
	cannot contain whitespace.

	FORTH is case-sensitive.  Use capslock!

	Enjoy!

\\ .\" is the print string operator in FORTH.  Example: .\" Something to print\"
\\ The space after the operator is the ordinary space required between words.
\\ This is tricky to define because it has to do different things depending on whether
\\ we are compiling or in immediate mode.  (Thus the word is marked IMMEDIATE so it can
\\ detect this and do different things).
\\ In immediate mode we just keep reading characters and printing them until we get to
\\ the next double quote.
\\ In compile mode we have the problem of where we're going to store the string (remember
\\ that the input buffer where the string comes from may be overwritten by the time we
\\ come round to running the function).  We store the string in the compiled function
\\ like this:
\\   ..., LITSTRING, string length, string rounded up to 4 bytes, EMITSTRING, ...
