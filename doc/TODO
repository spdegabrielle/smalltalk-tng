*** Challenges

 - a definition location for messages to travel to (SOLVED by use of
   blue calculus with DCHAM-style joinish formulation)

   - model the STORE - this gives nice properties for forwarders,
     garbage-collection-modelling, forces thought about exception
     handling and runtime-failure etc etc.

 - a way of lifting all locations with a particular channel in their
   path (unknown)

 - a means of dynamically scoping certain names, eg. class definitions
   ("String") and helpers ("MEMOIZE", "ST80DISPATCH")

   - investigate KLAIM - they may have some possible solutions.
