Research directions:

 - Partial-evaluation in ThiNG r3/r4

 - Hygiene. How should bindings-as-values ensure lexically-apparent scoping?

 - Trait composition

 - Binding of self in methods. Explicit parameters mess with the
   model... and yet they're somehow cleaner than an implicit
   semi-dynamic parameter...
