To start up:

	$ sdl-csi tng.scm

You don't need to compile to .so yet - the interpreted versions work
fine and we don't yet need the speed.

Roadmap:

image.scm		- image save/load code
interp.scm		- (empty) will contain bytecode interpreter
kernel-methods.scm	- primitive definitions
kernel.scm		- image bootstrap code, primitive table, method glue
macros.scm		- macros used by more than one file
morph.scm		- (unfinished) will contain morphic-like UI definitions
oo.scm			- core object structures and dispatch code
root-hooks.scm		- include file defining global image structures
sdl-events.scm		- include file defining available SDL event types
sugar.scm		- (unfinished) aborted attempt at a macro-based parser
tng.scm		******* - MAIN FILE - LOAD THIS INTO sdl-csi
ui.scm			- SDL-interface definitions + main loop
util.scm		- various utilities
